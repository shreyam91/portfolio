# Modern JavaScript Features You Should Know

JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, introducing powerful features that make development more efficient and code more readable. Let's explore some of the most useful modern JavaScript features.

## 1. Optional Chaining

The optional chaining operator (`?.`) allows you to safely access nested object properties:

```javascript
const user = {
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St'
  }
};

// Old way
const street = user && user.address && user.address.street;

// New way
const street = user?.address?.street;
```

## 2. Nullish Coalescing

The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) provides a way to handle null or undefined values:

```javascript
const name = null ?? 'Anonymous';
console.log(name); // 'Anonymous'

const count = 0 ?? 42;
console.log(count); // 0
```

## 3. Array Methods

Modern array methods make data manipulation more intuitive:

```javascript
// Array.flat()
const nested = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
const flat = nested.flat(2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Array.flatMap()
const sentences = ['Hello world', 'How are you'];
const words = sentences.flatMap(s => s.split(' '));
```

## 4. Template Literals

Template literals provide an elegant way to work with strings:

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
const multiLine = `
  This is a
  multi-line
  string
`;
```

## 5. Destructuring

Destructuring makes it easy to extract values from objects and arrays:

```javascript
// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = person;

// Array destructuring
const [first, second, ...rest] = array;
```

## Conclusion

These modern JavaScript features can significantly improve your code quality and development experience. Start incorporating them into your projects to write more efficient and maintainable code.
