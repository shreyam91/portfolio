# The Tools I Use Daily as a MERN Developer

As a MERN stack developer, my workflow is powered by a collection of tools that streamline development, boost productivity, and help me stay organized. Whether I'm building full-stack applications, debugging complex issues, or collaborating with others, these tools are essential to my daily routine.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code Editor: VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my go-to code editor. It's fast, customizable, and has a massive ecosystem of extensions. Some of my favorite extensions include:

- **Prettier**: for automatic code formatting.
- **ESLint**: to catch JavaScript errors early.
- **GitLens**: for enhanced Git capabilities inside the editor.
- **MongoDB for VS Code**: to explore databases directly from the editor.

## üåê Frontend: React + Supporting Tools

React is the backbone of my frontend development. To make things smoother, I often use:

- **Create React App / Vite**: for bootstrapping projects.
- **React Router**: for handling navigation.
- **Redux Toolkit / Context API**: for state management.
- **Tailwind CSS or Styled Components**: for styling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend: Node.js + Express

For building APIs and backend logic, I rely on:

- **Express.js**: for creating fast, minimalist RESTful APIs.
- **Nodemon**: for automatic server restarts during development.
- **Postman or Thunder Client (VS Code Extension)**: for testing APIs.
- **Joi or Zod**: for input validation.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Database: MongoDB

My go-to NoSQL database is MongoDB. I use:

- **MongoDB Atlas**: for cloud-hosted database services.
- **Mongoose**: for object modeling and schema validation.
- **Compass**: for GUI-based database visualization.
